            <p class="intro"> I was born and raised in Bronx, New York City. Lived there for 21 years until I joined the United States Air Force to pursue a better life and never looked back. After my honorable discharge in 2017, I worked as an elevator mechanic for a year and found myself back in aviation. Working at MD helicopters as a general mechanic building helicopters. I left to pursue my goals in hopes of becoming a software developer and putting more focus on improving my skills as well as completing school. </p>

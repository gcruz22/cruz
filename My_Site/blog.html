              <h2>Imposter Syndrome in Technology</h2>
              <p>Software developers, though a rewarding profession, are somewhat cursed with having to constantly learn new skills just to keep up with the evolution of technology. This brings a feeling of inadequacy where a newly employed developer may begin to ask themselves  “What am I doing here”, “I should have never applied”, and “I got here purely from luck, I don’t deserve this position”. A feeling that is rooted in a superficial view of the people around them, and if never acknowledged it can make someone become self-destructive and suffer from  Imposter Syndrome.</p>
              <p>This phenomenon begins when a person starts to doubt their own skills and achievements and begin to internalize the fear that others will discover them as fraudulent. In the tech industry, Imposter syndrome is common. It is the starting point for many other mental health conditions and because of the number of computing languages used to create products, software developers of every skill level are constantly learning and are forced to grow with the rapid pace of technology.</p>  
              <p>Understanding and recognizing Imposter Syndrome in technology Is important because of the mental illnesses that may follow. Everyone has a certain tech stack they are proficient in. A Tech stack is a combination of programming languages, tools and frameworks that the developers use to create web and mobile applications. For example the internet is an open source playground made up of hundreds of languages and is supported by multiple communities of people who are driven to create. This can make things a little complicated since there are many ways to develop, and there is always rivalry or bias towards the best languages used to develop.</p> 
              <p>Many times when a developer starts at a new company, they often face the obstacle of having to learn a completely new language. So regardless of experience, developers often question if their skill is up to par with their colleagues. According to a survey in 2019 15,922 people responded to the mental health question admitting 8.8% have emotional disorders such as depression, and 8.6% have an anxiety disorder. This is an increase from the 2018 survey where 11,431 people responded saying 8.5% were affected by depression and 7.6% of the people were affected by anxiety (Stack Overflow). These demographic numbers expose a few key points. On this website alone, 4,491 more people provided input in 2019 than 2018 on their own mental health, showing an increase in awareness. Another key point is in the paragraph explaining the disability chart; it states “Mental health issues like depression and anxiety are particularly common among our respondents. In the United States, almost 30% of respondents said they deal with a mental health challenge, a higher proportion than other large countries such as the UK, Canada, Germany, or India.” An increase from the 20% the survey was taken the year prior (Stack Overflow).</p>           
              <p>It is no secret that anyone can suffer from imposter syndrome, learning how to recognize the signs is a good start to managing this condition. A popular resource for this overall topic is Dr. Valerie Young's ”The Secret Thoughts of Successful Women: Why Capable People Suffer From Imposter Syndrome and How to Thrive in Spite of It”. Where she breaks down individuals suffering from I.S. into five categories: The Perfectionist, The Natural Genius, Soloist, The Expert, and The Superman/women. First, The Perfectionist strives to do their absolute best regardless of their mental health, overstressed and overwhelmed they may take on more than able to. Second is The Natural Genius, who set high goals for themselves because they lived a life where everything came naturally for them. Never having to deal with an intellectual obstacle and set high goals for themselves trying to get things done on the first try. Third is The Soloist, who will refrain from asking for any help, in fear of being discovered as a fraud. Fourth is The Expert, where despite being skilled, never acknowledges their skill and feels inferior in comparison to fellow colleagues. Last is The Superman/woman, work addicted people who never seem to take a break (Young).</p>
              <p>These people share similar traits where they refuse to ask any questions in fear of being discovered as incompetent, try to take on more than they are actually able to handle just so they can prove worth, and even set unrealistic expectations of themselves and try to achieve out-of-reach goals. Eventually, these people never take it slow and build relationships within the workplace. Involuntarily creating social distance and anxiety. </p>
              <p>These 5 categories often reflect the common types of people in technology. Although many people see some of these habits as part of their identity, often they overlook why they perform certain behaviors. Many of these people never build social relationships because they overwork, they are scared of being discovered as a fraud, or they simply never make time to meet with people. </p> 
              <p>Although this condition can severely affect people, there are many ways to seek help and get through it. Being overworked and fatigued can increase chances of mistakes. Maybe the work environment pushes too hard to meet deadlines, or coworkers are making their peers feel insecure by projecting a narcissistic attitude. Maintaining control over one’s mental health allows increase in productivity as people are able to focus on the work at hand instead of brooding over negative thoughts and emotions.</p>  
              <p>Arlin Cuncic, author of the self-help book “The Anxiety workbook”, wrote an article for the website Theverywellmind.com on the overlap between Imposter Syndrome and Social Anxiety Disorder. She writes “To move past these feelings, you need to become comfortable confronting some of those deeply ingrained beliefs you hold about yourself” (Cuncic). Her article goes into the importance of sharing your feelings, talking to someone or seeking professional help from a therapist. Find someone you are able to confide in. Take time in learning the skills and never compare yourself to anyone. </p>
              <p>Imposter Syndrome affects people of every skill level, this means even people in senior positions may be dealing with the same stress. Never let it take over and focus on the micro goals that keep the motivation thriving . With learning comes mistakes and with mistakes follows growth. Mitigating stress wherever possible will help maintain focus will reduce the chances being affected by I.S, stress, and depression. A personal mantra I often tell myself is a quote by Dan Harmon, The co-creator of the hit show “Rick and Morty”. A fan asked him on social media for advice on how to deal with depression, to which he responded  “Feelings are real but they’re not reality”. The feelings are valid and one should never dismiss them, but observe the evidence. One can say they feel lonely, and have plenty of supportive people around them but due to the overwhelming sadness, may not immediately see it in such perspective.</p>
              <p>The battle against Imposter syndrome and other mental health conditions does not end at simply recognizing and controlling it. The topic of mental health stigma in society is another battle where many are fearful to take on head first. Often people never want to speak up because they refuse to be a part of a stereotype. Scared of being viewed as the person with “problems”. </p>
              <p>According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI.org) writes, “ Their symptoms have been referred to as “a phase” or something they can control “if they only tried.” They have been illegally discriminated against, with no justice. This is the unwieldy power that stigma holds”(Greenstein). A few ways people can battle against the stigma would be to talk to people about your situation, be open to sharing your struggles, empathy is very powerful. Talk kindly and always uplift people. For those who do not experience mental conditions, be mindful that no two people are the same. Educate by reading up on the condition to further understand how to carry conversation with the individual. Via online media or the library. </p>
              <p>I personally deal with A few mental health conditions and a lot changed when I became open about it. I explained to my coworkers, friends, and family what I was going through and although at first I was hesitant, I was surprised by the amount of support I received, Although it was not always positive I made sure to stick up for anyone who was dealing with the same issues. To my surprise, many people around me began to open up and confide in me. With my transparency, others were inspired to follow suit and built a community of trust and support with one another.</p>
              <p>Always maintain control when facing any struggles whether it be internal or external. Imposter Syndrome sounds harmless at first but can have devastating effects on a person’s health. This mental health condition is becoming more recognized every year and the more people can learn from them, the more people can help one another. Recognizing Imposter Syndrome and the 5 categories it falls into can help us mitigate the incline of mental health conditions in technology, creating a better work environment. We can always do our part by removing the mental health stigma, and understanding people at a deeper level.</p>
